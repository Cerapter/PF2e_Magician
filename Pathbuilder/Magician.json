Once someone believes that something unusual is about to occur, even if only for a moment, the will of a magician can effortlessly bring that thing into existence; the limits of the almost impossible are where magicians find their greatest strength. One could watch a padlock lie on a table for a hundred years and it would never spontaneously unlock, but that’s not to say that it’s impossible. <br>The audience to their performances need not be friendly, and it is actually fairly unusual for true magicians to perform for money or fame, instead using their performances to gain an advantage over their enemies as they clash blades.
